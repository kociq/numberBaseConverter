# numberBaseConverter (wip) - supporting bases up to 36
1. Enter two numbers in format: {source base} {target base} (To quit type /exit)
2. Enter number to convert.
3. The number gets converted :) You can convert another one with the same source and target bases or go back to choosing them by typing /back
